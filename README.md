Playing around with the large number of characters that our sweet [George R.R Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin) killed on the
HBO Serie [Game of Thrones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones).

As a huge GOT fan I decided to create this small website showing a little information of those dead characters ðŸ˜¢
